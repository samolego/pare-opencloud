# üí∞ Pare - Expense Tracking Web App

Pare is an expense tracking and bill splitting web extension built for OpenCloud.
It provides an interface for managing bills, with the ability to split them with different members.
It also keeps track of settlements, so you can see who owns the money and quickly settle the bills.


Think like baby Nextcloud Cospend. Like really simple.

**Please note**: This project was made with the help of AI. The code has been reviewed, but there's places it could be improved or refactored still. This will hopefully change in the future :).
